# Docker Home Server for ARM64

Welcome to **Docker Home Server for ARM64**! This repository contains a collection of `docker-compose.yaml` files optimized for running various services on a home server based on the ARM64 architecture, such as Raspberry Pi, ODROID, or other ARM devices. The goal of this project is to simplify the setup and management of applications using Docker in an ARM64 environment.

## Features
- A collection of `docker-compose.yaml` files for popular services.
- Optimized for ARM64 architecture.
- Easy to use and customizable to fit your needs.
- Simple documentation for each service.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (latest version for ARM64).
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- A Linux-based operating system supporting ARM64 (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu Server ARM).

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sh4dowByte/docker-home-server-for-arm64.git
   cd docker-home-server-for-arm64
   ```

2. **Select a Service**
   Navigate to the folder of the service you want to use, for example:
   ```bash
   cd appwritelite
   ```

3. **Configuration (Optional)**
   Customize the `docker-compose.yaml` file or create an `.env` file to set environment variables such as passwords, ports, or data directories.

4. **Run the Service**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Stop the Service (If Needed)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Contributing
We warmly welcome contributions! If you have a `docker-compose.yaml` file for another ARM64-compatible service, feel free to:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add the new service in a separate folder.
3. Submit a pull request with a brief explanation.

## Notes
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to run Docker.
- Some services may require port or volume adjustments based on your environment.
